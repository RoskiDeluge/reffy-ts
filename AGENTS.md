# Reffy Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.references/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions early-stage ideation, exploration, brainstorming, or raw notes
- Needs context before drafting specs or proposals
- Refers to "reffy", "references", "explore", or "context layer"

Use `@/.references/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- Reffy workflow and artifact conventions
- How Reffy and OpenSpec should be sequenced
- How to store and consume ideation context in `.references/`

Keep this managed block so `reffy init` can refresh the instructions.

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
